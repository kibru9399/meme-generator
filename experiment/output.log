Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

This photograph captures a stunning aerial view of New York City's skyline at sunset. The sky is painted with warm hues of pink, orange, and purple, with soft clouds adding texture. Prominent buildings include the Empire State Building, with its green spire, centrally located, and the distinctive, jagged-edged One World Trade Center on the right. The city's dense array of skyscrapers, ranging from modern glass structures to older brick buildings, is bathed in the golden light of the setting sun. The Hudson River is visible in the background, adding depth to the urban landscape. The overall atmosphere is serene yet vibrant, highlighting the city's iconic architecture against a picturesque sky.
when skyscrapers meet sunset, they get lit 💡🏙️✨

When the sun goes down in the city, the buildings start looking like they're wearing little party hats 🎉🏢🌇

Sunset in Manhattan = skyscrapers getting ready to turn up 🔥🏙️🌅

When NYC buildings see the sunset, they're like "Yaaas, it's time to turn on the lights!" 🏢🌇💡

The city that never sleeps, but the buildings definitely do 😴💡🏙️

When the sky is painted pink and orange, the city lights up like a Christmas tree 🌅🎄🏢

Sunset in the city = buildings getting their glow on 🌅🏢🔦

Skyscrapers at sunset: they're just getting started! 🌅🏢🔥
"Yo, check out this sick view of New York City! We're totally gonna jump off that building over there and do some sweet parkour moves. Just look at the Empire State Building with its green top, it's like a giant jump pad just begging to be conquered. And that other building with the weird triangle on top? Totally a perfect trampoline. We'll just leap off the roof and do a few flips before landing on the street. Easy peasy, right? The sunset is giving us all the vibes, and the city lights are already on, so it's like the whole place is ready for us. Let's go, bro!"
